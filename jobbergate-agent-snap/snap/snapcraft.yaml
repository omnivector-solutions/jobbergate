  The Jobbergate Agent Snap deploys the Jobbergate Agent Python package on your host system. This agent
  is an essencial component of the Jobbergate platform for managing and submitting jobs to HPC clusters.

  This snap requires a few configuration values to be set before it can be used. These values are:
  - base-api-url: The URL of the Jobbergate API server where the agent will send its data. Setting/unsetting this value is more interesting when using the snap in a development environment; do not change it otherwise.

  - oidc-domain: The domain of the OIDC server that the agent will use for authentication. Setting/unsetting this value is more interesting when using the snap in a development environment; do not change it otherwise.

  - oidc-client-id: The client ID of the OIDC application that the agent will use for authentication.

  - oidc-client-secret: The client secret of the OIDC application that the agent will use for authentication.

  - task-jobs-interval-seconds: The interval in seconds at which the agent will run its internal task jobs, hence sending data to the Jobbergate API server. This is optional and defaults to 30 seconds.

  - task-self-update-interval-seconds: The interval in seconds at which the agent will check for updates to itself. This is optional and defaults to 30 seconds (1 hour).

  - sbatch-path: The absolute path to the *sbatch* command on the host system. This is optional and defaults to /usr/bin/sbatch.

  - scontrol-path: The absolute path to the *scontrol* command on the host system. This is optional and defaults to /usr/bin/scontrol.

  - default-slurm-work-dir: The default working directory that the agent will use when submitting jobs to the SLURM cluster. This is optional and defaults to /tmp.

  - slurm-user-mapper: The user mapper that the agent will use to map the system user name to the SLURM user name. This is optional and defaults to none.

  - single-user-submitter: The system user name that the agent will use to submit jobs to the SLURM cluster on behalf of in case the *single-user-submitter* is not set. This is optional and defaults to *ubuntu*.

  - write-submission-files: A boolean value (true, false) that indicates whether the agent should write submission files to disk. This is optional and defaults to false.
