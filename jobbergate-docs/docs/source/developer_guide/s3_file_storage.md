# S3 File Storage

Besides the information kept in the database, application and job-scripts files are
stored in an S3 Bucket.

The bucket is named according to the `S3_BUCKET_NAME` environment variable used by
the Jobbergate API.

Within the the bucket, there should be two top-level folders, and the structure should
appear similar to:

```
<S3_BUCKET_NAME>
├── applications
│   ├── 1
│   │   ├── jobbergate.yaml
│   │   ├── jobbergate.py
│   │   ├── template1.py.j2
│   │   └── template2.py.j2
│   └── 2
│       ├── jobbergate.yaml
│       ├── jobbergate.py
│       └── template.py.j2
└── job-scripts
    ├── 11
    │    └── jobbergate.txt
    └── 12
         └── jobbergate.txt
```


## applications

This 'folder' will contain all the files uploaded for Applications. Each entry in this
folder will be named with a single integer that corresponds to the `id` for the
Application's entry in the database.

Within each one of the individual application folders, there will be the following:

 - jobbergate.py (the application source code)
 - jobbergate.yaml (the application config),
 - At least one template file with any file name and a `.j2` or `jinja2` extension.


## job-scripts

This 'folder' will contain all the files uploaded for Job Scripts. Each entry in this
folder will be named with a single integer that corresponds to the `id` for the
Job Script's entry in the database.

Within each one of the individual application folders, there will be one text file
named `jobergate.txt`. This will contain the rendered Job Script that will be
submitted to Slurm when a Job Submission is created.
