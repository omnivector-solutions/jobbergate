# Jobbergate Apps

**TODO**: Rewrite

Jobbergate is comprised of 3 separate python applications that work in concert. These
applications allow Job Scripts to be created and submitted to a
[Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) cluster without the Jobbergate
user having to inteact directly with Slurm or remotely access the cluster by command
line at all.

An overview for each and a usage document are included in the pages listed below.

The three apps in Jobbergate are:

- [Jobbergate API](./api.md)
- [Jobbergate CLI](./cli.md)
- [Jobbergate Agent](./agent.md)
