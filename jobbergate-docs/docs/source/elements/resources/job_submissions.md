Job Submissions
---------------

**TODO**: Rewrite this mess

Job Submissions stimply track the status and metadata for a Job Script that has been
submitted by Jobbergate to a Slurm cluster. It carries identification information that
tie it to both the Job Script in the Jobbergate data store and to the Job objects that
Slurm uses.
