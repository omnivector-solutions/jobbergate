# Jobbergate Resources

**TODO**: Rewrite this

Jobbergate has three main resources (represented as database tables) that it uses to
manage job templating and submission. These are stored as tables in a postgres database
and are accessed through separate endpoints in the API and with separate subcommands in
the CLI.

The three main resources in Jobbergate are:

- [Job Script Templates](./job_script_templates.md)
- [Job Scripts](./job_script_templates.md)
- [Job Submissions](./job_script_templates.md)
