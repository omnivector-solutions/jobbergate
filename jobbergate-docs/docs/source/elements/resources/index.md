# Jobbergate Resources

Jobbergate utilizes three primary resources for the efficient management of job script creation, templating, and
submission. These resources are maintained in distinct database tables and can be accessed via individual API endpoints
or through specific subcommands in the CLI.

The principal resources of Jobbergate include:

- [Job Scripts](./job_script_templates.md)
- [Job Script Templates](./job_script_templates.md)
- [Job Submissions](./job_script_templates.md)
