This project began as a rewrite of the original `Jobbergate project <https://github.com/HeMan/jobbergate>`_ authored by
Jimmy Hedman. The original provided the inspiration for an interactive tool used to gather template variable values to
render jinja2 templates into Slurm job scripts. Building upon Jimmy's great idea, Jobbergate has grown into an entire
system for managing and submitting reusable Slurm jobs, but the core idea of reusing templates combined with user input
for the template values has remained the core of the project throughout its evolution.
