Updated the `validate_job_state` validator to support data_parser 0.0.40.

In Slurm 24.11, the `--json` flag from the `scontrol show job` command uses the
data_parser 0.0.40. According to the official [documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_state_codes.html#overview),
the job flags can be returned alongside the job state, which can make the `job_state` key to have multiple keys. This
change prevents any validation error when fetching job's data by returning the first available state.
