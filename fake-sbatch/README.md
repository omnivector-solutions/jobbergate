# Fake sbatch

A testing utility that returns `sbatch` output assuming a certain failure percentage.

By default, `fake-sbatch` will fail 10% of the time (for testing error cases).



## Usage

```shell
fake-sbatch
```

The command above should produce output like:

```
fake-sbatch: Submitted batch job 653898
```


## Settings

If you wish to override the fail percentage (for example, if you wanted it to always or never fail),
you may set the it with: `FAKE_SBATCH_FAIL_PCT=1.0`. 1.0 means it will always fail. 0.0 means it will
never fail.

You can also control the range of randomly produced slurm job id values by adjusting the `FAKE_SBATCH_MAX_JOB_ID` and
`FAKE_SBATCH_MIN_JOB_ID` settings.


## Setting up to use with Jobbergate CLI

A simple way to make the `fake-sbatch` executable available for jobbergate is to install it via `pipx`.

Simply, navigate to the root of the `fake-sbatch` repository and execute:

```shell
pipx install .
```

Then, in your Jobbergate environment, apply the setting `SBATCH_PATH=fake-sbatch`
