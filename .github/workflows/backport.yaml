# Backport changes to more release branches based on labels on merged PRs.
# For instance, backport/3.5 or backport/3.6 would create new PRs for review on those branches.
# Still experimental on Jobbergate.
# Inspired on Poetry: https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/master/.github/workflows/backport.yaml
