name: Prepare for release

# This action:
#   - Is triggered manually in a workflow dispatch;
#   - Inquire the kind of release in a dropdown menu;
#   - Use Poetry to bump up the versions;
#   - Create a new header for the new version at the changelogs;
#   - Check if all sub-projects share the same version number;
#   - Create a new branch named release/<new_version>;
#   - Open a draft PR to the main branch, so all the changes above can be reviewed by the team before merging.
